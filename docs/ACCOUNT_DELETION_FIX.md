# üîß Account Deletion Fix - Complete Solution

## üéØ Problem Identified

The account deletion was failing because the backend was doing a **soft delete** of the profile but then trying to delete the user from Supabase Auth, which failed due to **foreign key constraints**.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`/Backend/routes/auth.ts`)

**Before (Problematic):**
```typescript
// Soft delete profile
await supabase.from('profiles').update({ is_active: false })

// Try to delete from Supabase Auth (FAILS due to FK constraints)
await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(user.id)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// 1. Delete all dependent rows in correct order
await supabase.from('business_invitation_usage').delete().eq('used_by', user.id)
await supabase.from('business_invitation_codes').delete().eq('created_by', user.id)
await supabase.from('push_subscriptions').delete().eq('user_id', user.id)
// ... (all dependent tables)

// 2. Update nullable foreign keys to NULL
await supabase.from('orders').update({ modified_by: null }).eq('modified_by', user.id)
await supabase.from('businesses').update({ owner_id: null }).eq('owner_id', user.id)

// 3. Delete profile row (now safe)
await supabase.from('profiles').delete().eq('id', user.id)

// 4. Delete from Supabase Auth (now works)
await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(user.id)
```

### Frontend Changes

**Enhanced verification:**
- Waits for backend deletion to complete
- Verifies Supabase session is cleared
- Tests backend endpoint to confirm deletion
- Comprehensive cleanup of all storage

## üóÇÔ∏è Tables Handled in Deletion Order

1. `business_invitation_usage` (used_by)
2. `business_invitation_codes` (created_by)
3. `push_subscriptions` (user_id)
4. `notification_logs` (user_id)
5. `error_logs` (user_id)
6. `backup_metadata` (user_id)
7. `Indexes` (user_id)
8. `conflict_resolutions` (resolved_by)
9. `employees` (user_id)
10. `orders` (modified_by ‚Üí NULL)
11. `businesses` (owner_id ‚Üí NULL)
12. `profiles` (current_business_id ‚Üí NULL, then DELETE)
13. `auth.users` (DELETE via Supabase Admin API)

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Test Backend Directly
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-backend-deletion.js
```

### 2. Test Full Flow
```bash
# Clean build
./cleanup-pwa.sh

# Test in browser
# 1. Login
# 2. Go to Settings > Delete Account
# 3. Confirm deletion
# 4. Verify redirect to /auth
# 5. Check console for success logs
```

## üìã Expected Logs

### Backend (Terminal):
```
üóëÔ∏è Starting cascade deletion for user: [user-id]
‚úÖ All dependent rows deleted/updated successfully
‚úÖ Account successfully deleted for user: [email] ([id])
```

### Frontend (Browser Console):
```
‚úÖ Account deletion request successful
‚è≥ Waiting for backend deletion to complete...
üîç Verifying account deletion...
‚úÖ Supabase session error (expected after deletion)
‚úÖ Backend confirms user is deleted (401/403 response)
üßπ Starting complete authentication cleanup...
‚úÖ Complete cleanup finished
```

## üö® If Issues Persist

### 1. Check Backend Logs
```bash
cd ../Backend
deno run --allow-all main.ts
# Look for cascade deletion logs
```

### 2. Verify Database Constraints
```sql
-- Check if there are any remaining FK constraints
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND ccu.table_name = 'profiles';
```

### 3. Manual Database Cleanup (if needed)
```sql
-- Only run if automatic deletion fails
-- Replace :USER_UUID with actual user ID

-- Delete in correct order
DELETE FROM business_invitation_usage WHERE used_by = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM business_invitation_codes WHERE created_by = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM push_subscriptions WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM notification_logs WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM error_logs WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM backup_metadata WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM "Indexes" WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM conflict_resolutions WHERE resolved_by = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM employees WHERE user_id = ':USER_UUID';
UPDATE orders SET modified_by = NULL WHERE modified_by = ':USER_UUID';
UPDATE businesses SET owner_id = NULL WHERE owner_id = ':USER_UUID';
UPDATE profiles SET current_business_id = NULL WHERE id = ':USER_UUID';
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE id = ':USER_UUID';
```

## üéØ Result

After this fix:
- ‚úÖ Account deletion works completely
- ‚úÖ No foreign key constraint errors
- ‚úÖ User session is properly cleared
- ‚úÖ No Service Worker errors
- ‚úÖ Clean redirect to /auth page
- ‚úÖ No persistent authentication state

## üìù Notes

- This is a **destructive operation** - data is permanently deleted
- Consider implementing a "soft delete" option for production if data retention is required
- The cascade deletion follows the exact order recommended by Supabase AI
- All foreign key constraints are properly handled
